#Jeopardy Respository
There are over 200,000 questions and answers that include airdate, show number, round(Double Jeopardy or Jeopardy), category, and value.

#Technologies
This project was started using [Node-Catapault](https://github.com/mindeavor/node-catapult/).

###Data
Using a csv collection of [jeopardy questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/), I created a postgres database that I query for a random question.
